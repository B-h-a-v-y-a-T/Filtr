## Overview

Filtr helps users quickly narrow down and explore data using intuitive filters and a snappy UI. The project is structured as a TypeScript-based frontend with Tailwind CSS, and a Python backend (see the `backend/` directory). The repository is configured for modern developer tooling and includes a ready-to-use Render deployment configuration.

If you have a one-line product pitch or problem statement, add it here to make your landing more compelling.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm (or Bun) installed
- Python 3.10+ (recommended) for the backend

### Frontend

Using npm:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Using Bun:
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start dev server (if scripts are defined)
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview
```

Open the dev server URL printed in your terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

### Backend

The backend lives in `backend/`. If you have a framework and dependency file set up, a common workflow looks like:

```bash
# From the project root
cd backend

# Create & activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
# If you have a requirements file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run your backend server (example)
# uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

- Document the exact backend commands in `backend/README.md` for clarity.
- If you use Docker (e.g., a Dockerfile in backend), add build/run steps here.

---

## Environment Variables

Add any required variables here. For example:

- Frontend
  - `VITE_API_URL` â€” URL of your backend/API

- Backend
  - `PORT` â€” server port (e.g., 8000)
  - Other secrets as needed (database URLs, API keys, etc.)

Create a `.env` file (and/or `.env.local`) and never commit secrets to the repository.

---

## Scripts

Common scripts (check `package.json` to confirm exact names):

- `dev` â€” start Vite dev server
- `build` â€” build production assets
- `preview` â€” preview the production build locally
- `lint` â€” run ESLint (if configured)

If you use Bun, prefix commands with `bun run`.

---

## Deployment (Render)

This repository includes a `render.yaml` for infrastructure-as-code deployment on Render.

Typical steps:
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a new Web Service and connect this repository.
3. Render will read `render.yaml` and set up services accordingly.
4. Ensure environment variables are configured in Render.

Update `render.yaml` as your app evolves (frontend, backend, static hosting, etc.).

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "feat: add your feature"`
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin feat/your-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request
